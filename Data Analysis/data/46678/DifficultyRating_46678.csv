Task;Difficulty;Comment
unrolledSort;1; only requires to check what order it sorts into
power;1;well known approach
countLetters;3;slightly confusing that list of strings was list of single characters
binaryToDecimal;2;took a moment to recognize binary conversion
validParentheses;2;exact meaning of last if was non-trivial to parse
binarySearch;2;well known algorithm, slightly obfuscated by identifiers
commonChars;3;long, nonsensical identifiers are hard to parse
prime;1;well known simple algorithm
linearSearch;1;very straightforward
capitalizeFirstLetter;2;line 6 slighly harder to parse
arrayAverage;1;very common calculation
bubbleSort;2;well known algorithm, only had to check loop correctness
forwardBackward;2;easy enough to parse but less common then other algorithms, 
factorial;1;common algorithm, easily identified
containsSubstring;4;harder to parse what exactly the effect of the nested for loops is, break conditions feel unintuitive at first glance
crossSum;2;easy to understand but less well known than other algorithms
squareRoot;1;easy to understand
leastCommonMultiple;1;very straightforward approach
countIntegerInterval;3;requires some parsing of condition in line 6
palindrome;2 easy to understand once effect of loop and declaring l is clear

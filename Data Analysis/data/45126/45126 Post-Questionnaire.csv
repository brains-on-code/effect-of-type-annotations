3;Will be easier if the code is not obfuscated;4;Time to party;"At first I tried to look at the code line by line and comprehend it linearly, after
a while I realized some of them are already well-established algorithms, so
in that case I tried to recognize which algorithm it is and just applied it.";"At first I was a bit overwhelmed by the variable names and trying to match
which name belongs to which variable, and that was quite frustrating. After a
while I stopped doing so and instead just focused on the logic and that made
things easier and I became more efficient.";True;"Helped me distinguish between strings and lists. And since the variable
names are not very helpful, at some point I just ignored the names and
remembered the types instead.";True;"If I already know the types then it would be easier to prepare myself for the
kind of operations that could happen to them. And also help me quickly see
what the input and output should look like. So it is also easier to guess what
the functions are trying to achieve.";"Generally later snippets are easier because I felt more prepared,
experienced and confident in doing the task."

4;"- it’s difficult to not knowing the variable names
- some variable names are too long to remember in their next call
- the function names are also hidden, make it difficult to guess what the function body implements";2;"- my eyes got tired after focusing on a certain point for too long
- have to both remember the variable names and run algorithm in my head";"after time i noticed the code are not newly implemented, they are just
common algorithms, so i try to match patterns that i detected from the
code and matched it with common algorithms i remember";"I focus more on the data type given in the function name to guess
what will those data be dealt with in the function body";True;"- I used it to guess what will those data be dealt with in the function body
- And to match with common algorithms i remembered";True;"In general, yes, it helps me speed up my code reading and
understanding process, as i have more information to guess with the
function will do";The later is easier

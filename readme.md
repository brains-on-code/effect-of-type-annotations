## Instructions for Replication

### Eye Tracker Specifications
In our study, we used the Tobii EyeX\footnote{https://help.tobii.com/hc/en-us/articles/212818309-Specifications-for-EyeX} eye tracker to collect gaze data at a frequency of 60 Hz. The Tobii EyeX is a portable eye tracker that utilizes near-infrared light to track the position of the eyes. It has a tracking population of 95 %, ensuring precise measurements.
The Tobii EyeX is compatible with screens up to 27 inches and has an operating distance range of 50 - 90 cm. The track box dimensions, representing the area where eye movements can be accurately captured, are approximately 40 x 30 cm at a distance of 75 cm. 
To ensure accurate eye-tracking measurements, we instructed participants to position themselves at the right distance and position to the Tobii EyeX according to the manufacturer's instructions. 

### Study

1. Run the study program by opening the `Study` folder in Microsoft Visual Studio and running the `Study.sln` solution file.

2. Administer the post-questionnaire to participants after they complete the study tasks.

### Data Analysis

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r data_analysis/requirements.txt
    ```

4. Copy the raw data files from the 'Study' folder to the 'Data Analysis' folder.

5. Set the configuration parameters in the `config.py` file in the `Data Analysis` folder.

6. Run the data analysis pipeline:
    ```bash
    python data_analysis/RunPipelineData.py
    ```
